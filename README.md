## Made with React

Had a lot of fun making this app with React and exploring function component (hooks).

## Typescript superset

Exploiting best JS practices with Typescript. Gives a good amount of type checking security and avoid bugs in production releases.

## Troubleshootings

Nivo.js has some excellent graphics available! However I had some good amount of pain making the reactive radar to work properly. I guess it's not yet totally stable. Sometimes the responsiveness needs a page refresh to work entirely.
